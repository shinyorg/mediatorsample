Forked from the amazingly popular original FFImageLoading Library, this Compat version FFImageLoading.Compat aims to ease your migration from Xamarin.Forms to .NET MAUI with a compatible implementation to get you up and running without rewriting the parts of your app that relied on the original library.

This Maui version which merges all Transformations & SVG library parts into ONE and is migrated from FFImageLoading.Compat aims to fix some critical bugs and gives you a place to submit Maui releated issues.

The Google webp format image support. (It works in Xamarin.Forms version, but not in FFImageLoading.Compat)
