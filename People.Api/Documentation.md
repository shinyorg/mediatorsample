## Shiny Mediator
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

Shiny Mediator is a mediator pattern implementation, works for server, but also works great for apps.  Apps have pages with lifecycles that don't necessarily participate in the standard
dependency injection lifecycle.  .NET MAUI generally tends to favor the Messenger pattern.  We hate this pattern for many reasons which we won't get into.  That being said, we do offer a messenger subscription in our Mediator for where interfacesand dependency injection can't reach.
